## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Refactor all the stuff**: it now updates only plugins manifested at
  [Awesome Neovim] for now. Extracting non-Neovim plugins from any neat
  site that manifests them, and a custom mechanism to manifest plugins
  here would be future tasks.

[Awesome Neovim]: https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim

### Added

- Support for [sourcehut] repositories
